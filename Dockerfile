# Step 1: Use a Node.js image to build the app
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Build the Vite app
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Use a lightweight NGINX image to serve the build
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the build output from the previous stage to NGINX's default directory
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Start NGINX
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
